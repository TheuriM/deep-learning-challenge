# Alphabet Soup Charity Success Prediction
This project involves creating a neural network model to predict the success of organizations funded by Alphabet Soup using a dataset of over 34,000 records. The analysis includes data preprocessing steps like dropping non-informative columns, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features. The initial model, comprising an input layer, two hidden layers with ReLU activations, and an output layer with a sigmoid activation, was trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. Optimization strategies such as adding more neurons, an additional hidden layer, and increasing training epochs improved model performance. The final report includes results, recommendations for using models like Random Forest for enhanced interpretability.
